    <string name="MainBuilding">In 1920, Fr. Ruaño, O.P. was assigned to draw up plans for the UST Main Building to be constructed at the Sulucan property of the Dominican Order. During the years 1922 and 1923, the plans were finally completed. However, some fine tunings may have been made on the design criteria as a result of the new lessons learned from the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1, 1923 which flattened Tokyo and Yokohama. Eventually, construction began in 1924.
The structure is a rectangular building having a dimension of 86 meters long and 74 meters wide with two interior courtyards or patios. The most significant feature is the fact that it is actually made up of 40 separate structures independent from one another with the only opportunity provided by pre-cast stab flooring.But some locations of the separations are now difficult to determine exactly because of the numerous cosmetic changes the interior of the building which has undergone over the years.

    <string name="Arch">The Arch of the Centuries was originally erected in 1611 at Intramuros, where UST was originally established. When the university transferred to its present location at Sampaloc, the Arch was also carried piece-by-piece and was re-erected at the present Plaza Intramuros in 1954.
The original Arch which faces the Main Building was the main doorway to the university building before it was destroyed during World War II when it was at Intramuros. A newer arch faced España Boulevard, which is a reconstruction of the original arch.
In January 25, 2010, it was declared a National Cultural Treasure, along with the University Main Building, the Central Seminary Building, and the university field, by the National Museum of the Philippines.</string>

    <string name="Arch2">The Arch of the Centuries is a triumphal arch at the Plaza Intramuros of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in Manila, in the Philippines that stands fifteen metres away from the university\'s Millenium Gate along España Boulevard. The present single structure puts together, back-to-back, the ruins of the original Intramuros arch, which faces the Main Building, and its replica, fronting España Boulevard. The arch was formerly the original entrance to the university when the campus was still in Intramuros during the years from 1611 to 1941. It was declared by the National Museum as a National Cultural Treasure on January 25, 2011.</string>

    <string name="Arch3">All incoming students (freshmen and transferees), as parts of their initiation rites into the university, known as the Thomasian Welcome Walk are required to pass through under the Arch. Candidates for graduation, on the other hand, also pass through under the Arch during a parade after their Baccalaureate Mass. This tradition started on June 2002. Fireworks display ends the passage and signals the party afterwards. The parade, either of freshmen or graduating seniors, is done per college/faculty in random order.
There is an old superstition that while studying at the university, one should not pass under the arch until he graduates. If done so, an event will happen that will bar his graduation from the university.</string>
